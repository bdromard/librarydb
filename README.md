<h2> üìñ About the project </h2>
Personal library management software. 
<br>This project is the first Python software I made from scratch, and was meant for me to progress in my Object Oriented Programming learning in Python, with both frontend and backend components.
<br>I have not been working on this project in the last few months.
<br>It uses the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France's API to find bibliographical references and adding them to a database's collection. 
<br>At the moment, the software allows the user to add references to a collection (with the book's ISBN or its title), to create a collection, and to show the collection's contents.
